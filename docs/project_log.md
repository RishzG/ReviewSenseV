## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end system that:
- ingests and transforms raw customer review data,
- structures it for analytics,
- applies AI-powered analysis,
- and delivers insights through an interactive application interface.

---

## Progress Summary

### Phase 1 — Project Planning and Problem Definition
**Completed**
- Defined the project scope and selected customer review analysis as the core use case.
- Identified the main problem: customer reviews are unstructured and difficult to analyze manually at scale.
- Outlined the overall system idea, including data storage, transformation, AI analysis, and frontend delivery.

**Key Outcome**
- Established a clear project direction focused on turning raw reviews into actionable business intelligence.

---

### Phase 2 — Data Pipeline and Transformation
**Completed**
- Ingested review data into Snowflake.
- Organized data into structured layers for downstream processing.
- Built dbt models to transform raw review data into analysis-ready tables.
- Performed data validation and quality checks through the transformation process.

**Key Outcome**
- Created a reliable analytics foundation for downstream querying and AI-powered insight generation.

---

### Phase 3 — Application Development
**Completed**
- Built the frontend using Streamlit.
- Built the backend using FastAPI.
- Connected the application layers so the frontend can send requests to the backend and display returned results.
- Integrated the backend with Snowflake-based data and AI-driven workflows.

**Key Outcome**
- Delivered a working end-to-end application that supports interactive review analysis.

---

### Phase 4 — AI and Insight Generation
**Completed**
- Integrated AI-powered analysis components into the system workflow.
- Enabled generation of summaries, sentiment-oriented insights, and issue-focused outputs.
- Structured the application to support intelligent review exploration and business insight generation.

**Key Outcome**
- Demonstrated how AI can transform large volumes of raw review text into more accessible and actionable outputs.

---

### Phase 5 — System Integration and Debugging
**Completed**
- Tested the full workflow across frontend, backend, dbt, and Snowflake.
- Resolved environment setup and authentication issues.
- Configured Snowflake key-pair authentication for stable local execution.
- Successfully ran dbt models and tests.
- Successfully started and validated both backend and frontend services locally.

**Key Outcome**
- Achieved a stable and presentation-ready application workflow.

## Current Project Status
The project is currently in the final presentation preparation stage.

### Completed
- End-to-end system architecture established
- Data ingestion and transformation pipeline completed
- dbt models successfully executed
- FastAPI backend running successfully
- Streamlit frontend running successfully
- Snowflake integration validated
- AI-powered insight workflow connected
- Demo-ready local environment confirmed

### In Progress
- Preparing final presentation slides

---

## Key Challenges Encountered
- Snowflake authentication and local environment configuration
- Aligning dbt configuration with project environment variables
- Coordinating frontend, backend, transformation, and AI layers
- Making the full system stable enough for live demo presentation

---

## Key Lessons Learned
- Building a successful AI application requires strong integration across data, backend, frontend, and model layers.
- Reliable configuration and authentication workflows are critical for smooth development.
- Clear separation between raw data, transformed analytics data, and AI application logic improves maintainability.
- Demo readiness depends not only on core functionality but also on environment stability and workflow clarity.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Expand support for additional product categories and datasets
- Improve evaluation methodology and benchmarking
- Optimize latency and cost efficiency
- Strengthen deployment readiness for production use
- Enhance user experience and analysis flexibility
- Add more advanced monitoring and analytics workflows
